### Hello! 👋
[Visit my personal web](https://dand-code.github.io/cv_dand-code/)

I am journalist 🗞 and I am passionate by user experience and accessibility. Because of this, I decided run into the coding career 👩‍💻 and continue improving my knowledge and skills.

:rocket: I'm focused on:
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.

:round_pushpin: [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) was my first school, and I want to continue studying to become a full-stack developer and contribute to large projects.

But in between, I would also love to have a good conversation about:
- :coffee: Coffee
- 🎬 Series (I am always open to suggestions)

Let's talk!
