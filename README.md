### Hello! 👋
[Visit my personal web](https://dand-code.github.io/cv_dand-code/)

I am passionate by user experience and accessibility. Because of this, I decided run into the coding career 👩‍💻 and continue improving my knowledge and skills.

:rocket: Now I'm learning:
-Typescript;
- Advanced JavaScript.

:round_pushpin: I began studying programming by myself, and now I just finished [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) Bootcamp and learned more about:  
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.

✨ Funfacts:
I have two addictions:
- :coffee: Coffee
- 🎬 Series (I am always open to suggestions)

Let's talk!
