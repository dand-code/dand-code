I am passionate about user experience and accessibility. Because of this, I decided to run into a coding career 👩‍💻 and continue improving my knowledge and skills.

🚀 Now I'm learning:
- Recoil
- Advanced JavaScript
- Typescript


📍 I began studying programming by myself, and now I just finished [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) Bootcamp and learned more about:
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.

✨ Fun facts: I have two addictions:
☕ Coffee
🎬 Series (I am always open to suggestions)

Let's talk!
