### Hello! 👋
[Check out my Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/popupwords-app/omegbdlfeocacplbgonijebhibeblnml?hl=es) ⭐ [and its code.](https://github.com/dand-code/plugin-chrome)

I am passionate about user experience and accessibility. Because of this, I decided to run into a coding career 👩‍💻 and continue improving my knowledge and skills.

🚀 Now I'm learning:
- Advanced JavaScript
- Django
- Kubernetes
- Testing


📍 I started learning programming on my own, and then completed the [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab)  to further strengthen my skills, where I gained expertise in:
- HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.

✨ Fun facts: I have two addictions:
☕ Coffee
🎬 Series (I am always open to suggestions)

Let's talk!
